# ClassTimer

## Deprecation Notice: If possible, please use [WeakAuras](https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2) instead, this addon is no longer maintained

This is an addon to create timers for your own buffs and debuffs.

## General

player bars on left, target in middle, focus on right, all can be moved

To track CC Effects you must set the CCed mob as your focus if its not your target.

Only icons and time can be shown if you don't want bars.

The text can be customized in the options by using, "%s for spell name", "%a for applications", "%u for unit name eg target or player", "%n for mob name"

This mod is set up with AceLocale so anyone who wants to add other locals feel free :)

If you want other textures for the bars, get the AddOn SharedMedia.

Note: When adding values in the files, double parentheses are necessary on the last item in a table because it contains all the values from the function call and we only want the first one.

## Options

/classtimer or the LDB Launcher

## Credits

Must give Nymbia credits as he is a legend!
